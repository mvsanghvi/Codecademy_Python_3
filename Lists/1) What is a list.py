# 1. Examine the existing list heights in your code editor. A new student just joined the class!

#     Chloe is 65 inches tall

# Add Chloe’s height to the end of the list heights
#heights = [61, 70, 67, 64]
heights = [61, 70, 67, 64, 65]

#2. Remove the # in front of the definition of the list broken_heights. If you run this code, you’ll get an error in your terminal:
#SyntaxError: invalid syntax
#Add commas (,) to broken_heights so that it runs without errors.
#broken_heights = [65 71 59 62]
broken_heights = [65, 71, 59, 62]
