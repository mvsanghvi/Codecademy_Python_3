# 1. We want to have a way to store all of our classroom test score data.
# Using the provided table, create a two-dimensional list called class_name_test to represent the data. 
# Each sublist in class_name_test should have one student’s name and their associated score.
class_name_test = [["Jenny", 90], ["Alexus", 85.5], ["Sam", 83], ["Ellie", 101.5]]
print(class_name_test)

#2. Use double square brackets ([][]) to select Sam‘s test score from the list class_name_test. Save it to the variable sams_score.
# Print the variable sams_score to see the result.
sams_score = class_name_test[2][1]
print(sams_score)

#3. Use double square brackets ([][]) to select Ellies test score from the list class_name_test. 
# This time only use negative indices! Save it to the variable ellies_score. Print the variable ellies_score to see the result.
ellies_score = class_name_test[-1][-1]
print(ellies_score)
