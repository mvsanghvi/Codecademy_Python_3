# Python can also perform exponentiation. In written math, you might see an exponent as a superscript number, but typing superscript numbers isnâ€™t always easy on modern keyboards. Since this operation is so related to multiplication, we use the notation **.

#     # 2 to the 10th power, or 1024
#     print(2 ** 10)

#     # 8 squared, or 64
#     print(8 ** 2)

#     # 9 * 9 * 9, 9 cubed, or 729
#     print(9 ** 3)

#     # We can even perform fractional exponents
#     # 4 to the half power, or 2
#     print(4 ** 0.5)

# Here, we compute some simple exponents. We calculate 2 to the 10th power, 8 to the 2nd power, 9 to the 3rd power, and 4 to the 0.5th power.
# Calculation of squares for:
# 6x6 quilt
print(6 ** 2)
# 7x7 quilt
print(7 ** 2)
# 8x8 quilt
print(8 ** 2)
# How many squares for 6 people to have 6 quilts each that are 6x6?
