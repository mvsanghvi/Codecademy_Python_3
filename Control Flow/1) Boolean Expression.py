#To build control flow in our program, we need to be able to check whether a condition is true or not. 
# For this, we use Boolean expressions. # A Boolean expression is a statement that can either be true or false. 
# The statement must be answered by true or false only, and it must be verifiable with evidence. 
# It cannot rely on interpretation or opinion.
# To understand this, let’s go back to the ‘waking up’ example. 
# The first question, “Is today a weekday?” can be written as a Boolean expression shown below: 
"Today is a weekday."
#This expression can be true - if today is Tuesday, for example - or false if it’s a weekend. 
# There are no other options, we know the answer is verifiable, and it does not rely on an opinion. # Now, consider the following phrase:
"Friday is the best day of the week."
#  Is this a Boolean expression? No, this statement is an opinion and is subjective. 
# Someone might say that “Wednesday is the best day.” and their statement would be no less true or false than the one above. 
# How about the following phrase: 
"Sunday starts with the letter 'C.'"
#Yes, this is a Boolean expression since the answer can only be true or false and it is verifiable. 
# Even though the statement itself is false (Sunday starts with the letter ‘S’ and not ‘C’), it is still a Boolean expression.
# 1. Examine the following statement.

"The Earth revolves around the Sun."

# If you think it’s a Boolean statement, set the variable first_statement to "Yes". Else, set it to "No".  
first_statement = "Yes"
#2. Now, consider the following statement.

"The Moon is made of cheese."

#If you think it’s a Boolean statement, create a variable second_statement and set it to "Yes". Otherwise, set it to "No". 
second_statement = "Yes"
#3. Next, consider the following statement.

"Chocolate ice cream tastes better than vanilla."

#If the statement qualifies as a Boolean expression, initialize a variable third_statement to "Yes". 
# If it doesn’t, initialize the variable third_statement to "No". 
third_statement = "No"
