#Now that we understand Boolean expressions, let’s learn how to create them. In Python, we create Boolean expressions using relational and logical operators.
# -Relational operators compare two values and return True or False based on the operands. For this reason, you will sometimes hear them called comparison operators.
# -Logical operators are used to combine multiple Boolean expressions.
#The two relational operators we’ll cover first are equals to and not equals to.
# -The equals to operator (==) returns True if both its operands are the same. Otherwise, it returns False. For example, the Boolean expression a == b will return True if the values a and b are the same. Otherwise, it will return False.
# -The not equals to operator (!=) is the negation of the equals to operator. The Boolean expression a != b will return True if the values a and b are different. Otherwise, it will return False.
# We can create Boolean expressions by comparing two values using these operators as shown below: 
1 == 1     # Evaluates to True as the operands are the same 

1 != 1     # Evaluates to False as the operands are the same 

2 != 4     # Evaluates to True as the operands are different 

3 == 5     # Evaluates to False as the operands are different
 
'7' == 7   # Evaluates to False as the operands are different types 
#1. Determine if the following Boolean expression is True or False. Assign your answer as True or False in the variable first_expression.
2 * 2 == 2 + 2
first_expression = True
#2. Next, consider the following expression:
3 + 3 != 3 * 3 
#If the above Boolean expression is True, initialize a variable second_expression to True. Otherwise, initialize it to False. 
second_expression = True
#3. Now, consider this expression:
3 * 3 == '9'
#If the above Boolean expression is True, initialize a variable third_expression to True. Otherwise, initialize it to False.
third_expression = False
