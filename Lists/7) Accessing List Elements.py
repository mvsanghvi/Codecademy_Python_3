#1. Use square brackets ([ and ]) to access the 4th employee from the list employees. Save it to the variable employee_four.
employees = ["Michael", "Dwight", "Jim", "Pam", "Ryan", "Andy", "Robert"]
employee_four = employees[3]
#2. Paste the following code into script.py:
print(employees[8])
# 3. # Accessing an element that does not exist produces an IndexError.
# In the line of code that you pasted, change 8 to an index that exists so that you donâ€™t get an IndexError. Run your code again!
print(employees[6])
